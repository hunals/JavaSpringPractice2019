/*
Object -- instance of class or actual object created 
Class 
  is a blueprint/ template to an object 
  fields/ variables 
    -- instance variable -- define properties of object
    -- static variable  -- this is coming tomorrow 
    
  methods 
    -- instance methods --->  
       we need an object to use it 
       and it's mostly used for reading/ manipulating object's property 
       
    
    -- static methods 
      no object needed to use it 
      and mostly used for utility method 
        that has nothing to do with object's properties 
        
  Constructor 
    -- this is a special block of code that run automatically 
       each time an object is being created 
       
    -- it has same name as current Class
    -- it does not have return type 
    -- it can have any type of access modifier
    
    We can have multiple version of constructor 
      -- overloading 
          -- same rule apply as method (same name diff param list)
       
       public AC{
         
           boolean on; 
           
           same name as classname and must not have return type
           THIS IS NOT A CONSTRUCTOR 
           It is just a method happen to have same name as class name
           and return type is void 
           
           public void AC(){
             sysout("boom!")
           }
           
       
       }
       
       in Main method
       AC ac1 = new AC() ; 
       
       
       If a constructor is not defined in the class 
       compiler will provide one 
           --->>> default constructor -- no arg empty constructor 
       What if we have any constructor exists in the class
           --->>> we don't get default constructor by compiler 
           
    
    What's the most useful way to use constructor 
       initilize all the field values of an object while being created
