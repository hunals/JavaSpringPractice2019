//System testing : is called end to end testing , it includes
//Functional testing
//non-functional testing (performence , load testing)
//regression testing
//back end testing = data base testing
//Unit testing-> testing code (function,classes,proceeders), is code executes as per specification
//who is do Unite testing: developers
//Component testing -> testing single modules (component)
//Unite testing     vs     component testing
//Unite testing: white box , validates desin doc, done dev, should be done first,granular level
//Component testing: black box, validates requirement doc, done testers, should be done after unite testing,application level
//Integration testing -> it tests combined modules works as expected or not.
//come back at 8:15pm
//user acceptance testing (UAT) -> testing the functionality by business perpective
//Some business process or business requirement which only known by end users are either missed during the communication or misinterpreted BRD to FRD
//who is do UAT : end user or client
//Environment : testing in UAT env , they using testing data close to production data
// Client : government
// prject :
// end user : schools or library
// end user : group of people who works for client

//Test plan: is a document describing
//scope
//- testing scope
//approach- based testing levels (unite, component,int,sys,UAT) Test plan will be different
//resource - (manpower, software, hardware)
//schedule of testing activities- schedule should realistic
//test items-what feature to be tested and what feature not to be tested.
//testing task - roles and responsiblities.
//testing deliverables- test execution reports
//risks and it’s solutions-
//who create test plan doc: team lead
//testing team lead - managing team members , assing task to testers and create a report for test execution and send to managers.
//dev team lead-
//what is test strategy -icludes :
//scope
//approach
//testing types
//test priorities
//schedule
//who create test strategy: done by Project manager.

//test scenario :
//User should be able to login:
//1.check that when user enter invalid user id and invalid password , system should display pop up message “Please enter valid user id and password”
//2.check that user id and password left blank and user clicks on login button , system should display pop up ...
//3.Check that user enter valid user id and password and click on login button system should allows user to login
//4 checkc that user forgot password and click on reset password link
//Requirement traceability matrix-> maps and traces Requirement with test case
//What is the purpose of doing RTM: is identify that test cases are covered no functionality should missed during the testing .
//interview questions : how do you know all your test cases are covered?
//Who prepare RTM : business analisyt (BA)
//testers are updating RTM
